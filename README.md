# Heart Countdown
Everybody who has a long distance relationship knows the situation: Seeing each other for a couple of weeks, and then living apart for weeks, if not months. But if you found **the one** you know it's worth the wait.

To look forward to the moment the two of you see each other again, feel free to use this little page that shows a countdown in realtime. Behind the countdown there is a heart that has adjustable colors.

## Setup
Just set the variable 'countDownDate' to the date you see each other again. Optionally also set the colors for the little cubes that form the heart in the array 'cubeColors' (the amount of different colors is up to you).
