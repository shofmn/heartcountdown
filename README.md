# Heart Countdown
Everybody who has a long distance relationship knows the situation: After you see each other for a couple of weeks you have to live apart for weeks, if not months. But if you found **the one** you know it's worth the wait.

To look forward to the moment the two of you see each other again, feel free to use this little page that shows a countdown clock in realtime. Behind the countdown there is a WebGL heart that has adjustable colors.

## Setup
All configuration can be done in the `index.html` file. Just set the variable `countDownDate` to the date you see each other again. Optionally also set the colors for the little cubes that form the heart in the array `cubeColors` (the amount of different colors is up to you).

Last but not least, don't forget to **change the names** in the body as well as in the title.
